// URL's base name, so it is mount-point-agnostic — mount it at the track's path:
//
//	mux.Handle("/"+string(track)+"/", handler)
//
//	.../playlist.m3u8 (or any *.m3u8)  the HLS media playlist
//	.../manifest.mpd   (or any *.mpd)   the DASH MPD
//	.../<group-id>.<ext>                one segment — shared by both formats
//	.../init.<ext>                      the init segment, when supplied
//
// A fresh [*ledger.Reader] is opened per request. A Reader is single-consumer,
// and concurrent consumers each opening their own is the documented cheap
// pattern, so the handler does that rather than share one.

	// count what precedes the window, because a sliding playlist's

	// a player opening the stream starts on — it plays the previous session
	// through before reaching the current one — and [Options.Window] only
	// clears them once enough new segments have pushed them out.
	//
	// Above 1 keeps recent lifetimes listed, which suits a producer that
	// restarts briefly: a viewer already playing the old epoch reaches the
	// restart across a discontinuity instead of finding its segments gone.
	//
	// Lifetimes are counted per request from the newest group the walk finds,

	// is next built. Earlier epochs stay addressable; they are only absent from
